# Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes

## Overview

This project demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample application using Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a containerized application, showcasing a complete DevOps workflow.

## Features

- **Source Code Management**: Integrated with GitHub for version control.
- **Automated Build and Test**: Jenkins automates the build and test process using Docker.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application for portability and consistency.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline automates the CI/CD process from code commit to deployment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes handles deployment, scaling, and management of the application.
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring setup using Prometheus and Grafana for tracking application performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation server.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for packaging the application.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for deploying and managing applications.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization tools.
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy server or load balancer (optional).

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or a managed service like GKE, EKS, or AKS).
- Jenkins installed or running as a Docker container.
- Prometheus and Grafana set up for monitoring.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CI-CD-Pipeline-Docker-Jenkins-Kubernetes.git
cd CI-CD-Pipeline-Docker-Jenkins-Kubernetes
```
### 2. Set Up Jenkins
Navigate to the jenkins/ directory and build the Jenkins Docker image:

```
cd jenkins
docker build -t my-jenkins-image .
```
Run Jenkins in a Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 my-jenkins-image
Configure Jenkins by setting up your GitHub credentials and creating a new pipeline using the Jenkinsfile.

3. Build and Test with Jenkins
The Jenkinsfile is pre-configured to:

Clone the repository.
Build the Docker image for the app.
Run unit and integration tests.
Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
4. Deploy to Kubernetes
Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster using the provided YAML files:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
5. Set Up Monitoring
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using the configuration files in the monitoring/ directory:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana-config.yaml
Access Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
