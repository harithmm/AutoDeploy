# Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample application using Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. The pipeline is designed to automatically build, test, and deploy a containerized application, showcasing how DevOps practices can streamline development and operations.

## Features

- **Source Code Management**: Integrated with GitHub for version control.
- **Automated Build and Test**: Jenkins automates the build and test process using Docker.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application for portability and consistency.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates the CI/CD pipeline, managing the entire process from code commit to deployment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes is used to deploy, manage, and scale the application.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring application performance and health.

## Tech Stack

- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD automation.
- **Docker**: For containerization of the application and Jenkins.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project collaboration.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.
- **Nginx**: As a reverse proxy server (optional).

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or a managed service like GKE, EKS, or AKS).
- Jenkins installed or run as a Docker container.
- Prometheus and Grafana set up for monitoring.
